# Ganesh-Ji


"A festive webpage for Ganesh Chaturthi with blessings, diya animations, and Ganpati Aarti tone."

"This project demonstrates how to play audio automatically on a webpage without requiring user interaction. Using HTML5 <audio> with the autoplay attribute, the sound begins immediately when the page loads. It provides an engaging experience and is useful for background music, alerts, or interactive web applications."
